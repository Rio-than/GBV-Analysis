# 📚 Too Early to Marry, Too Soon to Drop Out
Exploring the impact of child marriage on girls’ education among pastoralist communities in Kenya—through my eyes.

## 💡 What Inspired Me
I grew up in a pastoralist community where child marriage was common. I was married off at a young age to a man older than my father. I dropped out of school to become a wife when I was still just a girl.

Later, I was rescued by an NGO in collaboration with the police. At the rescue center, I finally had access to basic needs—meals, pads, books, and safe play. I returned to school and completed both primary and secondary education. Today, I’m pursuing a diploma in education. I’ve even enrolled my daughter in boarding school, breaking the cycle of early marriage.

## ⚙ What This Project Does
📈 Shows how early marriage impacts dropout and literacy rates among girls

🌍 Compares trends across countries, especially in pastoralist regions of Kenya

🧠 Brings together data and personal narrative to drive awareness and change

📉 Highlights gender disparities in school completion

🔍 Provides clear visuals that advocacy groups and educators can use

## 🧪 How I Built It
I used Python for all data cleaning, analysis, and visualization

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly

The visuals were embedded in a simple Flask app to serve the dashboard

I used Jinja2 templates for integrating data stories with visuals

Data sources included UNICEF, World Bank, and UNESCO

## 🚧 Challenges I Faced
Getting reliable data from remote areas like Maasai communities

Processing emotional trauma while translating my story into data

Learning how to code and build visualizations with Python on my own

## 🎉 What I'm Proud Of
I transformed a painful experience into a tool for advocacy and education

I built the entire project using Python, even though I was new to it

I combined my personal story with data to make an impact that’s both emotional and evidence-based

## 📚 What I Learned
Python is a powerful tool for telling meaningful data stories

Girls can code, lead, and change their communities

Real change starts when stories are backed with facts

## 🔜 What’s Next
Translate the dashboard into Swahili and Maa

Add more case studies and survivor stories

Include regional policy recommendations based on the data

Expand with more interactive features using plotly or Dash
