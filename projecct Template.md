# Analyzing the Global Impact of Child Marriage on Education Outcomes: A Gender-Based Violence Perspective
## Project Summary
This project investigates the global impact of child marriage as a form of gender-based violence (GBV) on education outcomes, focusing on girls and young women across diverse regions and countries. The dataset includes child marriage rates, education dropout rates, out-of-school rates, completion rates, literacy rates, and demographic/socio-economic data from global sources. By leveraging data analysis and visualization tools, the project aims to uncover patterns, drivers, and consequences of child marriage on education outcomes, delivering actionable insights to policymakers, international NGOs, and advocacy groups working to reduce GBV and improve educational attainment worldwide.
## Problem Statement
Child marriage, a pervasive form of GBV, disrupts girls’ education globally, leading to higher dropout rates, increased out-of-school rates, lower completion rates, and reduced literacy, perpetuating cycles of poverty and gender inequality. Despite global efforts to address child marriage, data inconsistencies, regional disparities, and underreporting pose challenges. This project aims to analyze global datasets to identify high-risk regions, socio-economic drivers of child marriage, and their impact on education outcomes. The findings will support data-driven policies, global advocacy, and targeted interventions to mitigate GBV and enhance education access and retention.

# Technical Details
## Python Components
Python Version: Python 3.9 or above
Core Python Concepts to Be Used
Data Types: Lists, DataFrames for organizing structured global data (e.g., child marriage rates, education metrics)

Control Structures: Loops and Conditional Statements for filtering data by country, region, or gender

Functions: For modular data cleaning, analysis, and visualization workflows

File Handling: Reading/writing CSVs and Excel files containing global education and child marriage data

SQL Integration: Using sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy to query and manage structured GBV and education data

## Basic Python Libraries

 pandas: For data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis of child marriage and education metrics
 
 numpy: For numerical calculations and statistical analysis
 
 matplotlib / seaborn / plotly: For visualizing global trends and correlations (e.g., child marriage vs. literacy rates)
 
 sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy: For storing and querying cleaned global datasets
 
Tableau: For interactive dashboards and stakeholder presentations

# Program Structure

# Core Features Input Handling:

## Import data from CSVs, Excel files, and SQL databases containing global child marriage, dropout, out-of-school, completion, and literacy rates

Allow updates from cleaned datasets or new global survey data

## Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, inconsistent age ranges, and duplicate entries in global education and child marriage datasets

Normalize country names, gender categories, and socio-economic indicators across datasets

Convert non-"Countries" columns (e.g., rates) to numeric types while retaining the "Countries" column as an object (string) using pandas:

python
for col in ed1.columns:
    if col != 'Countries':
        ed1[col] = pd.to_numeric(ed1[col], errors='coerce')
        
# Analysis Phase:
Track child marriage rates by country, region, and year, correlating with education metrics (dropout, out-of-school, completion, and literacy rates)

Cross-analyze with socio-economic factors (e.g., poverty, urban/rural status, GDP per capita) and gender

Identify global trends, correlations (e.g., between child marriage and dropout rates), and outliers

Assess gender disparities in education outcomes linked to child marriage across regions
# Research Question
Does child marriage have a stronger impact on dropout rates for girls than for boys?

Which regions show the highest correlation between child marriage and low literacy rates?

How do completion rates differ between girls married before 15 vs. those who remain unmarried until 18?

Are interventions reducing child marriage also improving school completion and literacy rates?

# Visualization:

Use Python (seaborn/plotly) for detailed graphs (e.g., scatter plots of child marriage vs. literacy rates, bar charts by region)

Use Tableau for interactive dashboards (e.g., global heatmaps, regional trend timelines)

Create correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships between child marriage and education metrics

# Output:
Generate reports with insights on the global impact of child marriage on education outcomes

Recommend policy actions (e.g., global education initiatives, anti-child marriage campaigns) based on evidence

Feature 2: In-Depth Correlation Analysis

Description: Analyze correlations between child marriage rates and education outcomes (dropout, out-of-school, completion, and literacy rates) alongside socio-economic variables like poverty, geographic isolation, and economic development.
Python Implementation Approach:

Use pandas.merge() and groupby() to aggregate indicators by country, region, or year

Use numpy and pandas.corr() to compute correlation coefficients between child marriage and education metrics

Visualize correlations with seaborn.heatmap() or Tableau charts

Example:

python

import pandas as pd

import seaborn as sns
# Merge datasets and compute correlations
merged_data = ed1.groupby('Countries').mean()

correlation_matrix = merged_data.corr()

sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')

User Interface:

Tableau dashboards for visual exploration of global child marriage and education trends

Python-generated charts for automated insights in reports

Optional: Jupyter Notebooks with markdown explanations and visuals for stakeholder engagement

Program Design

## Modular Structure:

data_loader.py: Import and clean raw global data (child marriage, dropout, out-of-school, completion, literacy rates)

analysis.py: Perform correlation and trend analysis, focusing on education outcomes

visualization.py: Generate graphs and export to Tableau for global dashboards

db_manager.py: Interact with SQL database for structured queries

## Functions/Classes:

Reusable functions for loading new global datasets or extending analysis to other GBV forms

Example: Function to calculate correlations:
python
def calculate_correlations(df, exclude_col='Countries'):
    numeric_cols = [col for col in df.columns if col != exclude_col]
    return df[numeric_cols].corr()
    
# Potential Challenges

Data Gaps & Quality: Inconsistent formats, missing values in education or child marriage data, or underreported cases in certain countries

Cross-Country Comparability: Variations in data collection methods, definitions (e.g., child marriage age thresholds), and reporting frequency

Bias: Cultural differences and reporting practices may skew child marriage and education metrics

Data Integration: Merging datasets from multiple global sources (e.g., UNICEF, UNESCO, DHS) with differing formats and timeframes

Causality: Distinguishing child marriage’s impact on education from other factors like poverty, conflict, or school infrastructure

# Future Improvements

Predictive Models: Use machine learning to predict high-risk countries or regions for child marriage and education dropout

Interactive Dashboards: Build with Streamlit or Dash for real-time global stakeholder interaction

Geospatial Insights: Use GeoPandas or Tableau for detailed global and regional maps

Policy Mapping: Compare education and child marriage trends with global policies or international NGO interventions

Extended Metrics: Incorporate additional education indicators (e.g., enrollment rates, school quality) for a broader global analysis
